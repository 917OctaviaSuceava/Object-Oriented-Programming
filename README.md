-------- ASSIGNMENT 2 

- Replace the templated DynamicVector with the STL vector. Use STL algorithms wherever possible in your application (e.g. in your filter function you could use copy_if, count_if). Replace all your for loops either with STL algorithms, or with C++11's ranged-based for loop.

- Store data in a text file. When the program starts, entities are read from the file. Modifications made during program execution are stored in the file. Implement this using the iostream library. Create insertion and extraction operators for your entities and use these when reading/writing to files or the console.

- Use exceptions to signal errors:
  > from the repository;
  > validation errors â€“ validate your entities using Validator classes;
  > create your own exception classes.
  > validate program input.
  > store your movie watch list in a file. When the application starts, the user should choose the type of file between CSV or HTML. Depending on the type, the application will save the list in the correct format.

- Add a new command, allowing the user to see the movie watch list
- Create a UML class diagram for your entire application. For this, you can use any tool that you like.
